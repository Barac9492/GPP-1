   - Real-time price disparity calculation
   - Currency conversion (KRW ↔ USD)
   - User submission handling with validation
   - Points and reward system integration

2. **Comprehensive Testing Suite** (`backend/scripts/test-korea-us-crawler.js`)
   - 8 comprehensive test categories
   - Validation, performance, and error handling tests
   - Points calculation verification
   - User submission workflow testing

3. **Documentation & Guides** (`docs/KOREA-US-PRICE-GUIDE.md`)
   - Complete Korea-US e-commerce price disparity guide
   - User contribution workflows
   - Reward system design
   - Integration strategies
